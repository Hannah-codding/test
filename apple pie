	<h2> Baked Ricotta Cheesecake </h2>
    <h3> DIRECTIONS </h3>
       <pre>
         <H5>
           <ol> 
             <li> Preheat oven to 160°C/140°C fan-forced. Place a baking tray in oven. Release the base from a 20cm (base) springform pan and turn over. Place baking paper over base, allowing a 5cm overhang. Secure the base, paper side-up, back in pan. Spray side of pan with canola oil spray</li> 
             <li> Make pastry: Place flour, cornflour, sugar and butter in a food processor. Process until mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add egg and milk. Process until mixture just comes together. Remove 1/3 of dough. Wrap in baking paper. Refrigerate. Roll remaining dough out between 2 sheets of baking paper until 5mm-thick (about 30cm round). Remove top layer of baking paper. Carefully place baking paper, dough-side down into pan. Peel off baking paper. Press dough into pan. Refrigerate.</li>
             <li> Using an electric mixer, beat ricotta, cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add egg. Beat until combined. Spoon mixture into prepared pan. Roll remaining dough out between 2 sheets of baking paper until 5mm-thick (about 25cm round). Remove top layer of baking paper. Carefully place baking paper, dough-side down onto filling in pan. Peel off baking paper. Trim dough and press edges together to seal. Place pan on hot baking tray in oven. Bake for 50 minutes or until golden. Turn off oven. Cool cheesecake in oven for 4 hours with door ajar. Refrigerate overnight. Carefully run a palette knife or butter knife around cheesecake to help release from pan. Dust cheesecake with icing sugar and cinnamon. Serve.</li>

         <h2> Three Ingredient Condensed Milk Cheesecake </h2>
         <h3> DIRECTIONS </h3>
         <H5>
                <ol> 
                   <li> Preheat oven to 200C/180C fan forced. Grease and line base and side of a 20cm (base measurement) round springform pan with baking paper.   </li>
                   <li> Pour cream cheese mixture over biscuit base. Bake for 40 minutes or until cheesecake is firm to touch but still wobbles slightly in the centre. Turn oven off. Leave the cheesecake in the oven, with the door slightly ajar, until cooled completely (this will prevent the cake from cracking). Place in the fridge for 6 hours or overnight to set. </li> 
                   <li>   Place biscuits in a food processor and process until finely crushed. Transfer to a large bowl. Add 60ml ( 1⁄4 cup) of sweetened condensed milk and stir until well combined. Spoon biscuit mixture into prepared pan. Use the base of a flat-bottomed glass to press the biscuits over the base. Bake for 10 minutes or until light golden. Set aside to cool. </li>
                   <li>   Meanwhile, reduce oven to 170C/150C fan forced. Use electric beaters to beat the cream cheese and remaining sweetened condensed milk together in a large bowl until smooth.        </li>
                </ol>
        </H5>
